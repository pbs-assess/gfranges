# Part 1: Range shifts

when the environment changes, if they are to persist, organisms must be able to cope with change, change themselves, or move [@maggini_are_2011]

many terrestrial species from a range of taxanomic groups have moved to higher latitudes and elevations [@hickling_distributions_2006]

despite similar climate velocities, within regions, some species have rapidly extended their geographical distributions, while others have moved less, or have even moved in the opposite direction [@sunday_species_2015;@parmesan_globally_2003;@poloczanska2013].
